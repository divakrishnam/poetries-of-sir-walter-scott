            <p>Known for popular historical novels such as Ivanhoe and The Pirate, writer and poet Sir Walter Scott was
                born in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1771. He is notable in that he was popular throughout his lifetime and
                earned an international reputation that was highly unusual for the time. Many of his works are still
                seen as classics today and they have been filmed and serialized on TV for audiences across the globe.
